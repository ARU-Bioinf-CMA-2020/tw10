    "This notebook will be using data from a paper on protein networks in the eukaryotic ribosome. The original structure for this is pdb code 4v88 which has both the large (L) and small (S) subunits. The ribosome is basically an RNA machine for making proteins using the amino-acids provided by tRNAs. Protein decorate and stabilize the outside of the RNA - they also make contact with each other - very often through elongated projections that have been likened to the communicating extensions of neurones. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data in this notebook are from the analysis of these extensions in the 4v88 data by Poirot and Timsit (2016, Neuron-Like Networks Between Ribosomal Proteins Within the Ribosome. Sci Rep. 2016;6:26485. https://doi.org/10.1038/srep26485) \n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is interesting to look at the protein:protein interactions that they study in detail - it is important to remember that the ribosome is mainly RNA. You can see the structure if you load the 4v88 into ICM browser or at the PDBe webpage https://pdbe.org/4v88. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you do you will see how the proteins decorate the outer surface of the subunits. And that there is a cleft between the two subunits that allows the mRNA access to the active site. Because of this cleft, relatively few proteins from the small subunit can reach those in the large subunit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tables of interactions have been turned into the python data structures below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the network of contacts mentioned in the paper above (extracted from their tables S3 and S4). Many proteins have several contacts through elongated extensions."
